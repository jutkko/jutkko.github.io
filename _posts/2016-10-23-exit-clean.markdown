title:  "Exit Clean"
---

## Why is it important
It is hard to get rid of something. This can be Britain trying to get rid of EU,
a girl trying to get rid of her Ex or when you do <ctrl><c> you want to have
the program to exit completely.

### Good contract between the caller and callee
### It is dangerous to leave processes around
#### Homedir script (bash)
#### Garden containers (golang)

## Solutions for the two problems
### Top down
### Bottom up

## Good trick to know when we see the problem
