This is rather embarrassing. When I submitted my final year project in 2015, I
swore that I will never try to write anything formal in English. And yet I am
spending time to set this website up, and yet I am trying to write some English.
I guess if I write some [broken English][broken English] then I can get away
with it. Yo how about dat m8?

So let's talk about why I started writing these blogs. A few days ago, while
wandering on github I discovered [kkdai][kkdai]'s github
[repo][kkdaiProject52Repo], and it immediately got my attention. Can I do
something like that? It will be a huge dedication! It will be super rewarding
if I did end up pushing myself to learn and do something every week! It was
a hard call. At some point I even wanted to ignore it. Just pretend that you
have never seen it and walk away. But something inside me could not let it go.
Somethin'.

How hard is actually going to be? I tried to analyse the risk. And here were
my initial thoughts:

- I define what to do. I don't have to implement Pagerank if it is a complex
task! Well I actually don't know how complex it is and will probably add this
to the [backlog][trelloBacklog] at some point. So in terms of technical
difficulty, it **can** not be hard.
- I am lazy and big projects with large number of stories put me off. But at
the same time I like numbers, achieving high ranks in [Hearthstone][hearthstone]
or running at a new high pace makes me happy. Then this project can do exactly
the same! The one week span keeps the footprint of the projects small and
rewarding. Do, finish, chill and start something new again.
- I always wanted to do something as a side project outside my work. And always
fail to keep it up. Hopefully I am going to fail find a valid excuse to not do
this.
- Wait a minute, I cycled to work more than 90% of the time for the past 11
months! Who says I can't keep doing something.

So, without further due, here is the First Post on this blog and this will
finish the first project.
